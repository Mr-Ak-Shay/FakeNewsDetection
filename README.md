# FakeNewsDetection

Hey!
If you click my first file(FakeNewsDetection-2.ipynb), I have obtained the Fake Article from ChatGPT to test my model and you would have seen that the model would have precisely predicted "Fake".
If you click my second file(FakeNewsDetection.ipynb), I have obtained the Real Article from the dataset I had trained my model with, therefore, It predicted "Real"  

XD!
